     * Here the reason IsUnique that we have put false that for example Mardin has Derik and Kızıltepe it will be District-00001 and District-00002 and at the same time Antalya also has Alanya and Manavgat it will be District-00001 and District-00002 with different will be their CityId because when we open Antalya Districts and it will be listed its Districts so better to start from District-00001 and District-00002 if we put IsUnique =true then it will start from 1 until different number District Private Code will get but we don't want something like that
