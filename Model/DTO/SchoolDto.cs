     * SchoolL is L stand for Listing so if we want all our DTO as listed we will be using SchoolL and it will be mostly using for our ListForms for GridViews
     * [NotMapped] Whenever it creates our database that it will be added exra more columsn in School table such as CityName,DistrictName and [NotMapped] and Discriminator and so on in order to prevent that we use [NotMapped] attribute on our table
     * The reason we have created DTO because inside the School we have connected City,and District for example when we create CityBll since we don't have any connection such as Foreign Key
