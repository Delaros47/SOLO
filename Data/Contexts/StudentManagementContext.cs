     * Here we have added ADO.NET Entity Data Model to Data/Contexts folder so it automaticlly created like below and now since we will be using two context Normal Student Management Context another for Administration Context so since we will do some changes from both of them we will create generic BaseDbContext then StudetManagement will be implemented from it.if we didn't create our own Context then we should write the same codes in StudentManagementContext and AdministrationContext as well since BaseDbContext is generic first value asks for Context so we gave our Context second ask for TConfiguration and it is all about our migration and its options now we will create another class for it
